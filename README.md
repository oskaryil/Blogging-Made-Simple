# Blogging-Made-Simple
A simple blog system built on node.js with basic to none styling. 

Views are in Pug (previously Jade)

It is built using a MySQL database namned 'blog_posts' with a table namned 'posts'.
The following columns in the table:
- title VARCHAR
- content TEXT
- date CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
- id AUTO_INCREMENT

This is not a final build.
